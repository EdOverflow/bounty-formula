# MathJax

```
$$\forall C (0 \le C \le 10)$$

$$\forall n (n \in \Bbb{R}^+ : 1.0 \le n \le 3.0)$$

$$N = \frac{b_{max}}{(C_{max})^n}$$

$$b = N \times (C^n)$$
```

# LaTeX

```
\[\forall C(0 \le C \le 10)\]

\[\forall n (n \in \mathbb{R}^+ : 1.0 \le n \le 3.0)\]

\[N = \frac{b_{max}}{(C_{max})^n}\]

\[b = N \times (C^n)\]
```
